# Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures, Release 3.0

Computer Science is about problem solving. Is also the studie of abstracción.

problem-solving process.

- [ ] computer is like proceso in spanish word?

> Computer science is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out
of the problem-solving process. Given a problem, a computer scientist’s goal is to develop an
**algorithm**, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might
arise. Algorithms are finite processes that if followed will solve the problem. Algorithms are
solutions.

- [ ] Principles of algorithm and problem solving, what are the tools that a computer scientist must had.

_la ciencia de la computación es resolver problemas, estudiar el problema, encontrar la mejor solución e identificar todos los pasos necesarios para resolverlos desarrollando algoritmos que resuelven cada instancia del problema_

**Interface**: Is using the functions or methods provided by the designers, as a driver driving a car.

_Podemos detectar tres perspectivas desde donde ver un problema, el mecánico, el lógico y el abstracto._

_El lógico se refiere en mayor medida a la interfaz. El mecánico a como funciona, desde una perspectiva física._

_Estos puntos de vista se aplica también a la computación, los usuarios solo ven la interfaz_

> Computer scientists, programmers, technology support staff, and system administrators take a very different view of the computer. They must know the details of how operating systems work, how network protocols are configured,
and how to code various scripts that control function. They must be able to control the low-level
details that a user simply assumes.

> also called the client, does not need to know the details as long as the user is aware of the way
the interface works. This interface is the way we as users communicate with the underlying
complexities of the implementation. As another example of abstraction, consider the Python
math module. Once we import the module, we can perform computations such as

 ``` py
> >>> import math
> >>> math.sqrt(16)
> 4.0
>>>
```
> This is an example of procedural abstraction. We do not necessarily know how the square
root is being calculated, but we know what the function is called and how to use it.

_La parte que el usuario no ve se conoce como la caja negra_

## What Is Programming?

> Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer. 

Abstraction using to see the big picture and dont getting lost un details.

Abstraction data types ADT are logical descriptions with out focus in details.
